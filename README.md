# BalatJack - By the Go Gitters (Team 26)

BalatJack is a lightweight, browser-based twist on Blackjack that we're building as the final project for CSE110 at UC San Diego. The focus: well-made code, a fun game, and a well-structured development process that keeps quality high despite a tight schedule.

The game is simple - select some cards, play them, and earn some Chips - but don't go over 21! Each successful Blind Requirement reached, you'll get a random Joker to help you along. How far can you get before you miss the goal?

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone -> Install -> Test - in three commands:

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone git@github.com:cse110-sp25-group26/cse110-sp25-group26.git
cd cse110-sp25-group26

# 2. install deps
npm install

# 3. sanity check
npm run test

# 4. run the game loop test (command line)
node source/scripts/runGameLoopTest.js

# 5. try the web interface
# Open source/index.html in your browser
```

## 🎮 Game Loop

The game loop implementation manages the cycle of draw, discard, and send actions repeated per hand. It integrates with the existing Card, Deck, and Hand components and implements the blinds and antes mechanics.

Key features:

- Configurable discard limits per hand
- Blind and ante progression
- Console-based UI for testing
- Integration with the web interface

Try it out:

1. Run the command line test: `node source/scripts/runGameLoopTest.js`
2. Open `source/index.html` in a browser for the web interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML + CSS** - semantic, responsive visual pages
- **Vanilla JS** - No frameworks!
- **JSDoc** - API docs, compiles to `doc/scripts/` on `npm run docs`
- **Jest** - Unit tests (`npm run test`)
- **ESLint** - Code linting (`npx eslint .`)

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

1. Branch naming & rules -> [doc/BRANCHING.md](/doc/BRANCHING.md)

## 🏗️ Current CI Pipeline

| Step  | Command        | Automated Trigger       |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Tests | `npm run test` | PRs -> `develop`/`main` |
| Docs  | `npm run docs` | PRs -> `develop`/`main` |
| Lint  | `npx eslint .` | PRs ->` develop`/`main` |

All checks must pass before a protected branch can merge.
