# BalatJack - By the Go Gitters (Team 26)

BalatJack is a lightweight, browser-based twist on Blackjack that we're building as the final project for CSE110 at UC San Diego. The focus: well-made code, a fun game, and a well-structured development process that keeps quality high despite a tight schedule.
