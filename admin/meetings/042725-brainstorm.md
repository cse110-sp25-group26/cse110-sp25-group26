# 1. Purpose
This session brought the team together to define and refine the core concept of our project. We leveraged the screen sharing of Zoom/Discord and Microsoft Paint to create mockups, and use Miro to map out feature requirements and idneitfy potential challenges.

# 2. Meeting Overview
- Project Decision (20 minutes)
  - We were able to decided on the project rather quickly, as the game was the most developed idea prior to the meeting.
- Game design (40 minutes)
  - We spent some time deciding how the broader game might work, so that we could reason on further topics based on knowledge of the game we'd design.
- Miro Board Analysis (45 minutes)
  - We took some time to learn Miro and created several sticky-note boards capturing foreseen development hurdles, target audience profiles, and key performance indicators.
- Pitch Drafting (25 minutes)
  - Basing work off of the existing description of the game, we began to write the pitch document before deciding that would likely be better done asynchronously.
 
# 3. Key Discussion Points
- **Core Mechanics and Target Audience**: Emphasized base gameplay simplicity with the capability for analysis and expansion to allow for any level of player to learn and enjoy the game. Options are available to enable "power-scaling", but to the average player there is still a reasonable 8-ante goal.
- **KPIs**: Identified ways to measure how the project is going, and how to determine whether a task is successful.
- **Risks**: Identified some places where issues might be foreseen in the project, and drafted solutions to try and alleviate those issues.

# 4. Issues & Resolutons
- **Zoom Time Limit**: Hit the 40-minute cap on free Zoom meetings, transitioned to Discord to continue without interruption.
- **Internet connection**: Campus wifi has been slow and spotty across the board for a few days, which affected the meeting a bit due to audio clipping at the start and end of sentences.

# 5. Action Items & Next Steps
1. Finalize the pitch document for the in-person pitch
2. Refine KPI definitions and form a roadmap to completion
3. Schedule follow-up based on feedback to either plan development or revise pitch.
