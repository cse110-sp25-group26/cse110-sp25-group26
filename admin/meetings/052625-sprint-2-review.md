# Sprint 2 Review (May 26, 2025)

## Overview
This sprint had major progress, especially in comparison with the first sprint. After establishing proper communication channels and bringing the team up to date on the repository and documentation, there have been several large achievements this sprint.

## 1. Card Element (Min)
The Card Element was technically completed last sprint, but it has been a robust and extensible element which has worked well with other components as the UI has expanded. They feel nice to drag around and, with just a few tweaks, have played well with being moved between hands and around on-screen. I don't have a picture of it to add, but you'll see it in the Hand Element coming up next.

## 2. Hand Element (Yifei)
The majority of the time, Cards are in Hands. This means that having a nice-feeling Hand and the ability to move Cards around smoothly within them is critical for the user experience. This definitely meets that, and is a nice, smooth way to interact with the game. Here is a video of the Hand in action!

## 3. Review Checklist (Long)
The [PR Checklist](../../doc/REVIEWING.md) is thorough, but that makes it long. I don't believe anyone likes reading through a wall of text. Long made a checklist module which simplifies the process, and allows anyone conducting a review to keep track of all the pieces in a much nicer way!

## 4. Merge Wrangling (Min)
Behind these changes Min has been managing all of the merges so far, making sure that the code works properly with other simultaneous changes and keeping the code uniform. To most of us it doesn't even look like there are merge conflicts, which is amazing work especially given the increase in code volume throughout this sprint.
