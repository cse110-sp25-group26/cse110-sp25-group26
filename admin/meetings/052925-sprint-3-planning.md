# Sprint 3 Planning (May 27, 2025)

Due to an unexpected increase in implementation complexity and pre-code preparation in last sprint's implementations, much of this sprint will be finishing UI elements and tying together the game for testing and tweaks through finals week.

The tasks we will be trying to attempt are:
1. Implementing the Deck. There have been issues with this branch for the past almost week now trying to allow Codacy to merge the branch. This is high priority as a major portion of the UI development is blocked by the Deck currently.
2. Finalizing the implementation of the UI scorekeeper for the game to interact with.
3. Implementing the remaining parts of the backend game logic so that as the UI is implemented, the backend may also be integrated. This will also require the development of an interface between the frontend and backend, something like a `UIInterface`.
4. Global documentation is beginning to fall a bit behind. Some of the documentation, such as repository structure, CI/CD pipeline, and some function JSDoc headers need to be updated to reflect new changes.
5. We now have enough to begin work on some of the initial interactive elements, such as the main menu, Card animations, and some backend save game formats with the code in `gameHandler`.

Issues have been made or are already in progress for these in accordance to this meeting.
