# Card Game UI Layout

## Overall Structure

The game interface is contained within a main `div#stage` that uses Flexbox to divide the screen into two primary sections:

1.  **`aside#scoreboard`**: A fixed-width sidebar on the left, displaying game scores, stats, and general game actions.
2.  **`main#board`**: The main game area on the right, which occupies the remaining space and contains all interactive card elements and game state information.

## Notes on Styling and Responsiveness:

*   Global reset and base styles are applied.
*   `gameplay.css` contains specific styles for all the above elements, including colors, spacing, borders, and typography.
*   Responsive adjustments are made using media queries (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) to reflow and resize elements for smaller screens. For example, `#top-info-bar` and `#hand-strip` switch to column layouts on smaller screens.
