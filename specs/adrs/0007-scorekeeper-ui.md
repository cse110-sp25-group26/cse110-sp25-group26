# Position player’s hand at the bottom of the screen

## Context and Problem Statement

Card positioning can affect readability and ergonomics.  
Where should the player’s hand be placed on the game interface for optimal comfort and viewing?

## Decision Drivers

- **Ergonomics:** ease of reach on large screens  
- **Readability:** minimal occlusion of central play area  
- **Conventions:** matches most digital card games  

## Considered Options

- **Hand at bottom of screen**  
- **Hand at top of screen**  
- **Hand on left/right side**  

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Hand at bottom of screen"**, because it maximizes visibility of the play area and aligns with user expectations.  

### Consequences

- **Good:** Clear view of table; comfortable for mouse and keyboard users  
- **Bad:** Less screen space for UI elements at bottom; may need responsive adjustments  

### Confirmation

Review in UX design review, run responsive layout tests across screen sizes, and conduct user playtests.
