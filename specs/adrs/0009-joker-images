# Use Fisher-Yates Algorithm for Deck Shuffling

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a way for users to quickly and properly know which Joker card is in the Joker deck. How should we implement a way to quickly tell which joker is which at a glance?

## Decision Drivers

- User accessibility (all users can distinguish)
- Clarity (users can distinguish without research)
- Ease of implementation and maintenance

## Considered Options

- Announce each joker on entry
- Update the tooltips for the user to view the card
- Put the Joker name on the card
- Give each Joker a custom image

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multiple: Give each Joker a custom image and add new tooltips**. This provides a quickly accessible way to distinguish the Jokers (by image) while also allowing players who are unaware of what the image means to see what that Joker does on hover.

### Consequences

- **Good:**  
  - The user can tell easily the difference between Jokers
  - If desired, the tooltip provides more information on the Joker at any given point in the game
- **Bad:**
  - Requires more information to be stored per Joker
  - Requires custom card images for each Joker

### Confirmation

Verify during user testing that:
- Users are able to tell what Jokers do without research
- Images are viably distinctive and users may tell how they work quickly

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Announcing each Joker on entry

- **Good:** Very clear, immediately visible
- **Bad:** Can clutter the screen, becomes a nuisance if player already knows Joker

### Update the tooltips the user to view on the card

- **Good:** Very descriptive, user may immediately tell the full function of the Joker
- **Bad:** Long, and requires reading to understand

### Put the Joker name on the card

- **Good:** Allows for quick distinction between cards
- **Bad:** The name does not always aptly describe what it does. "Chipmunk" has no immediately knowable funciton as a Joker.

### Custom Joker Images

- **Good:** Allows immediate distinction between Jokers
- **Bad:** The image must correlate with the Joker, meaning many custom new Card images must be created for each Joker implemented.
